# HotSpot-GPU #

This is a GPU accelerated version of the HotSpot 5.02 architecture level thermal 
modeling infrastructure originally developed at the University of Virginia.

## Build Instructions: ##

To compile with OpenCL support, please run:

*make GPGPU=1*

Double precision kernel will be used by default. For OpenCL platforms that do 
not support double precision, you can compile the single precision kernel:

*make GPGPU=1 GPGPU_SINGLE=1*

Usually the difference between single and double precision results will be
below 0.01 degree, but please expect larger errors if you have a large
number of simulation time steps.

## How to Use: ##

The following new command line switches have been added:

* -gpu_enable (Default: 0, disabled)
* -gpu_device (Default: 0)
* -gpu_platform (Default: 0)

To enable GPU acceleration on OpenCL platform 0 device 2, add the following 
three new command line switches to HotSpot:

*-gpu_enable 1 -gpu_platform 0 -gpu_device 2*

## Tested Platforms: ##

* Radeon HD 7970 GHz Edition and R9 280X with fglrx-14.301 driver
* Intel(R) HD Graphics IvyBridge M GT2 with beignet 1.0.0
* Intel(R) HD Graphics Haswell GT2 Desktop with beignet 1.0.0

Comparing to a 2.6 GHz IvyBrige CPU, HD 7970 GHz Edition provides about 90X
speedup when the grid dimension is 1024X1024 double precision. Using single 
precision usually gives you doubled performance. The two Intel integrated 
graphic cards listed above provide over 20X speedup at 1024X1024 single 
precision.
